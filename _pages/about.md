In January 2023 I will take up a post-doctoral research position at the
University of Bath with Dr Elizaveta Suturina, where I shall work on
the accurate and robust simulation of paramagnetic nuclear magnetic
resonance spectra.

I obtained my MChem and PhD degrees in Chemistry at the University of Manchester in 2018 and 2022 working in the Chilton Group. My work focussed on the modelling of spin-phonon coupling in the electronic and magnetic properties of lanthanide single molecule magnets and qubits.

From March to October 2022 I remained with the Chilton group as a post-doctoral researcher, continuing my work on spin-phonon coupling and extending it to include the environmental degrees of freedom (crystals, surfaces, etc.).
