I obtained my an MChem and PhD in Chemistry from the University of Manchester
in 2018 and 2022 working in the Chilton Group. My research investigated the
role of spin-phonon coupling in the electronic and magnetic properties of
lanthanide single molecule magnets and qubits.

In March 2022 I began a one-year post-doc position in the Chilton Group,
continuing my work on spin-phonon coupling and extending it to include the 
environmental degrees of freedom (crystals, surfaces, etc.).

In January 2023 I will begin a new post-doctoral research position at the
University of Bath with Dr. Elizaveta Suturina, where I shall work on
the accurate and robust simulation of paramagnetic nuclear magnetic
resonance spectra.
