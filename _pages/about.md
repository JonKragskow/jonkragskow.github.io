In January 2025 I began an independent lectureship at the University of Bath.

From January 2023 to January 2025 I was a [Research Associate](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/jon-kragskow) at the University of Bath working for Dr Elizaveta Suturina. My research aimed to improve the quality of information we could extract from paramagnetic nuclear magnetic resonance spectra using density functional theory, particularly for transition metal complexes.

I obtained my MChem and PhD degrees in Chemistry at the University of Manchester in 2018 and 2022 working in the [Chilton Group](https://www.nfchilton.com). My work focussed on understanding the role of spin-phonon coupling in magnetic relaxation, principally in lanthanide single molecule magnets and qubits.

From March to October 2022 I remained with the Chilton group as a post-doctoral researcher, and continued my work on spin-phonon coupling by extending it to include environmental degrees of freedom in crystalline materials.
