As of January 2023 I am [Research Associate](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/jon-kragskow) at the University of Bath working for Dr Elizaveta Suturina. My research aims to improve the accurate and robust simulation of paramagnetic nuclear magnetic resonance spectra.

I obtained my MChem and PhD degrees in Chemistry at the University of Manchester in 2018 and 2022 working in the [Chilton Group](https://www.nfchilton.com). My work focussed on understanding the role of spin-phonon coupling in magnetic relaxation, principally in lanthanide single molecule magnets and qubits.

From March to October 2022 I remained with the Chilton group as a post-doctoral researcher, continuing my work on spin-phonon coupling and extending it to include environmental degrees of freedom in crystalline materials.
