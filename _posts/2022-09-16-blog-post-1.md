I recently had to plot some theoretical infrared spectra using the output
of a DFT optimisation and frequency calculation performed in Gausian and didn't
want to have to plot everything in Gaussview. Here's how to plot exactly the
same spectrum as Gaussview, and hopefully a clear explanation of what Gaussian
uses for `Intensity`.

## Running the calculation

Here's an example optimisation and frequency (`opt+freq`) calculation for
CO<sub>2</sub> using DFT (B3LYP XC Functional), and a reasonable basis set.

```
$RunGauss 
#p opt freq=HPModes b3lyp int=grid=ultrafine

I'm not going to explain how to run a calculation here in detail, but you'll need
`freq` in your routecard as above, and I would recommend `freq=HPModes` to print
vibrational mode information with a reasonable number of significant figures.

## Understanding the result

Gaussian will print the information you need to the output (`.log`) file in a
section with the following header

```
 Harmonic frequencies (cm**-1), IR intensities (KM/Mole), Raman scattering
 activities (A**4/AMU), depolarization ratios for plane and unpolarized
 incident light, reduced masses (AMU), force constants (mDyne/A),
 and normal coordinates:
```

When using `freq=HPModes` as above, it will print this header twice, where the
first section contains more precise displacements.

Sticking with the CO<sub>2</sub> example, the `.log` file contains

```

We only need the `Frequencies` and `IR Intensities` which are in units
of cm<sup>-1</sup> and km mol<sup>-1</sup> respectively.

```
                          PIU       PIU       SGG       SGU

The former are easy to understand, they're the frequencies of each vibrational mode computed within the harmonic approximation. The latter are more complicated, and are actually the integrated napierian (natural logarithmic) absorbances of each mode.

Experimentally, this is the integral of an absorption band

$$ \mathcal{A}_\mathrm{e}= \int_\mathrm{band}{\epsilon_\mathrm{e}\left(\widetilde{\nu}\right)\ \mathrm{d}\widetilde{\nu}} = \frac{1}{nl}\int_\mathrm{band}{A_\mathrm{e}\left(\widetilde{\nu}\right)\ \mathrm{d}\widetilde{\nu}} \\ = \frac{1}{nl}\int_\mathrm{band}{\ln\left[\frac{I_0(\widetilde{\nu})}{I(\widetilde{\nu})}\right]\left(\widetilde{\nu}\right)\ \mathrm{d}\widetilde{\nu}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \left[\mathrm{m \ mol^{-1}}\right]$$

Where $n$ is concentration $[\mathrm{mol \ m^{-3}]}$, $l$ is path length $[\mathrm{m}]$, 
$A_\mathrm{e}$ is the napierian absorbance, $\epsilon_\mathrm{e}$ is the napierian extinction coefficient $[\mathrm{m^2 \ mol^{-1}}]$, $I$ and $I_0$ are the transmitted and incident
radiation intensity respectively, and $\widetilde{\nu}$ is the wavenumber $[\mathrm{cm}^{-1}]$.

This quantity is calculated theoretically as

$$
\mathcal{A}_e=\frac{N_Ad}{12\epsilon_0c^2}\left|\frac{\partial\mathbf{\mu}_\mathrm{elec.}}{\partial Q}\right|^2\cdot \mathrm{kg\left(u\right)\cdot \mathrm{D^2\left(C^2Å^2\right)} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ [m \ mol^{-1}] }
$$

Where $N\mathrm{_A}$ is Avogadro’s number $\mathrm{[mol^{-1}]}$, $d$ is the degeneracy of the mode (assumed to be 1 for all modes), $c$ is the speed of light $\mathrm{[m \ s^{-1}]}$, and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space $\mathrm{[F \ m^{-1}]}$. The derivative is that of the electric dipole moment with respect to displacement along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ components of the mode vector $\mathrm{[D \ Å^{-1} u^{-1/2}]}$. The final two terms explicitly detail the conversion factors required to arrive at the final units of $[\mathrm{m \ mol^{-1}}]$:

$$
\mathrm{kg\left(u\right)} = \left(1.661\times{10}^{-27}\right)^{-1}\left[\mathrm{u\ kg}^{-1}\right]\\
\mathrm{D^2\left(C^2Å^2\right)}=\left(3.336\times10^{-20}\right)^2 \left[\mathrm{C^2Å^2D^{-2}}\right]
$$

So when Gaussian prints the `IR Intensities` of the modes, it means
$\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{e}$.

## Plotting the spectrum

Gaussview uses an area-normalised Lorentzian lineshape for each vibrational mode

$$
L(x) = \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{\frac{1}{2}\Gamma}{\left(x-x_0\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\Gamma\right)^2} \ \ \ \ [\mathrm{cm}] \\
\ \\

\int_{-\infty}^\infty L(x) \ \ \mathrm{d}x = 1
$$

where $\Gamma$ is the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the curve, $x$ is the energy
(frequency) of the incident radiation, and $x_0$ is the energy (frequency) of the vibrational mode.

The area of this function is then scaled to match the *linear* integrated absorption coefficent
which can be obtained as

$$
\mathcal{A} = \frac{100}{\ln{10}}\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{e} \ \ \ \ [\mathrm{km \ mol^{-1}}], 
$$

where $[\mathrm{km \ mol^{-1}}] = [\mathrm{1000 \ cm \ mol^{-1}}]$ .

Scaling $L(x)$ by this value will give a function with units of $[\mathrm{1000 \ cm^{2} \ mol^{-1}}] = [\mathrm{L \ mol^{-1} \ cm^{-1}}]$, i.e. the linear molar extinction coefficient $\epsilon$.

To plot all of the modes together as a single spectrum, simply sum $L(x)\times\mathcal{A}$ for each mode.
