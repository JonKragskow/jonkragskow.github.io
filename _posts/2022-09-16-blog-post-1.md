I recently had to plot some theoretical infrared spectra using the output
of a DFT optimisation and frequency calculation performed in Gaussian and didn't
want to have to plot everything in Gaussview. Here's how to plot exactly the
same spectrum as Gaussview, and hopefully a clear explanation of what Gaussian means by `IR Intensities`.

## Running the calculation

Here's an example optimisation and frequency (`opt+freq`) calculation for
CO<sub>2</sub> using DFT (B3LYP XC Functional), and a reasonable basis set.

I'm not going to explain how to run a calculation here in detail, but you'll need
`freq` in your routecard as above, and I would recommend `freq=HPModes` to print
vibrational mode information with a reasonable number of significant figures.

## Understanding the result

Gaussian will print the information you need to the output (`.log`) file in a
section with the following header

```text
 Harmonic frequencies (cm**-1), IR intensities (KM/Mole), Raman scattering
 activities (A**4/AMU), depolarization ratios for plane and unpolarized
 incident light, reduced masses (AMU), force constants (mDyne/A),
 and normal coordinates:
```

When using `freq=HPModes` as above, it will print this header twice, where the
first section contains more precise displacements.

Sticking with the CO<sub>2</sub> example, the `.log` file contains

```

We only need the `Frequencies` and `IR Intensities` which are in units
of cm<sup>-1</sup> and km mol<sup>-1</sup> respectively.

The former are easy to understand, they're the fundamental frequency of each vibrational mode computed within the harmonic approximation. The latter are more complicated, and are the integrated napierian (natural logarithmic) absorbances of each mode.

Experimentally, this is the integral of an absorption band

$$ \mathcal{A}_\mathrm{e}= \int_\mathrm{band}{\alpha_\mathrm{e}\left(\widetilde{\nu}\right)\ \mathrm{d}\widetilde{\nu}} = \frac{1}{nl}\int_\mathrm{band}{A_\mathrm{e}\left(\widetilde{\nu}\right)\ \mathrm{d}\widetilde{\nu}} \\ = \frac{1}{nl}\int_\mathrm{band}{\ln\left[\frac{I_0(\widetilde{\nu})}{I(\widetilde{\nu})}\right]\left(\widetilde{\nu}\right)\ \mathrm{d}\widetilde{\nu}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \left[\mathrm{m \ mol^{-1}}\right]$$

Where $n$ is concentration $[\mathrm{mol \ m^{-3}]}$, $l$ is path length $[\mathrm{m}]$, 
$A_\mathrm{e}$ is the napierian absorbance, $\alpha_\mathrm{e}$ is the napierian absorption coefficient $[\mathrm{m^2 \ mol^{-1}}]$, $I$ and $I_0$ are the transmitted and incident
radiation intensity respectively, and $\widetilde{\nu}$ is the wavenumber $[\mathrm{cm}^{-1}]$.

This quantity is calculated theoretically as

$$
\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{e}=\frac{N_\mathrm{A}d}{12\epsilon_0c^2}\left|\frac{\partial\mathbf{\mu}_\mathrm{elec.}}{\partial Q}\right|^2\cdot \mathrm{kg\left(u\right)\cdot \mathrm{D^2\left(C^2Å^2\right)} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ [m \ mol^{-1}] }
$$

Where $N\mathrm{_A}$ is Avogadro’s number $\mathrm{[mol^{-1}]}$, $d$ is the degeneracy of the mode (assumed to be 1 for all modes), $c$ is the speed of light $\mathrm{[m \ s^{-1}]}$, and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space $\mathrm{[F \ m^{-1}]}$. The derivative is that of the electric dipole moment with respect to displacement along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ components of the mode vector $\mathrm{[D \ Å^{-1} u^{-1/2}]}$. The final two terms explicitly detail the conversion factors required to arrive at the final units of $[\mathrm{m \ mol^{-1}}]$:

$$
\mathrm{kg\left(u\right)} = \left(1.661\times{10}^{-27}\right)^{-1}\left[\mathrm{u\ kg}^{-1}\right]\\
\mathrm{D^2\left(C^2Å^2\right)}=\left(3.336\times10^{-20}\right)^2 \left[\mathrm{C^2Å^2D^{-2}}\right]
$$

So when Gaussian prints the `IR Intensities` of the modes, it means
$\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{e}$.

## Plotting a spectrum

Gaussview uses an area-normalised Lorentzian lineshape $L(x)$ for each vibrational mode

$$
L(x) = \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{\frac{1}{2}\Gamma}{\left(x-x_0\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\Gamma\right)^2} \ \ \ \ [\mathrm{cm}] \\
\ \\

\int_{-\infty}^\infty L(x) \ \ \mathrm{d}x = 1
$$

where $\Gamma$ is the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the curve, $x$ is the wavenumber of the incident radiation, 
and $x_0$ is the wavenumber of the vibrational mode.

The area of this function is then scaled to match the *linear* integrated absorption coefficent $\mathcal{A}$.

To do this, first divide Gaussian's value of $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{e} \ \ [\mathrm{km \ mol^{-1}}]$ by $\ln(10)$ to move from logarithmic to linear
absorption coefficient. Then, its useful (see below) to multiply by 100 to change from $[\mathrm{km \ mol^{-1}}]$ to $[\mathrm{1000 \ cm \ mol^{-1}}]$. This may seem
confusing, but if you realise that $[\mathrm{km \ mol^{-1}}] = [\mathrm{1000 \ m \ mol^{-1}}]$ then it might make this step clearer. To sum up

$$
\mathcal{A} \ \ [\mathrm{1000 \ cm \ mol^{-1}}] = \frac{100}{\ln{10}} \cdot \mathcal{A}_\mathrm{e} \ \ \ \ [\mathrm{km \ mol^{-1}}], 
$$

The multiplication of $L(x) \ [\mathrm{cm}]$ by $\mathcal{A} \ \ [\mathrm{1000 \ cm \ mol^{-1}}]$ gives a function with units of $[\mathrm{1000 \ cm^{2} \ mol^{-1}}] = [\mathrm{L \ mol^{-1} \ cm^{-1}}] = [\mathrm{M^{-1} \ cm^{-1}}]$, i.e. common units of the linear molar extinction coefficient $\epsilon$.

To combine all of the modes as a single spectrum, simply sum $L(x) \cdot \mathcal{A}$ for each mode, and plot against wavenumber.

## Addendum - understanding Dipole Derivatives from Gaussian

If you want to obtain dipole derivatives with respect to normal modes using `iop(7/33=1)`, then Gaussian will print these in units of $\mathrm{\sqrt{km\,mol^{−1}}}$ (without saying so). Various forum posts and online resources tell you to divide by the square root of 42.2561 to get a dipole derivative in more reasonable units (i.e. in the above definition), but they often don't tell you where this number comes from. 

The Gaussian [website](https://gaussian.com/constants/) also lists the conversion factor

```text
1 Debye2-angstrom-2-amu-1 (IR intensity unit) = 42.2561 km-mol-1
```

This value comes from evaluating the constant terms in the of $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{e}$. 

$$
\frac{N_\mathrm{A}}{12\epsilon_0c^2}\cdot \mathrm{kg\left(u\right)\cdot \mathrm{D^2\left(C^2Å^2\right)}} = 42.2561\, \left[\mathrm{km\,mol^{−1}\,u\,Å^2\,D^{−2}}\right]
$$

All of this goes to say, be careful when using the output of Gaussian!

## Addendum - Dipole Derivatives in Cartesian basis

You can also obtain dipole derivatives with respect to normal modes **without** `iop(7/33=1)` by looking in the `.fchk` file for your calculation (obtained with Gaussian's `formchk` utility). You will quickly notice, however, that these numbers do not match those in the output file, as they are the derivatives with respect to single atom displacements along $x$, $y$, and $z$.

To obtain the derivatives with respect to normal modes, you first must generate the matrix of cartesian displacements $\mathbf{L_\mathrm{CART}}$, as detailed in the Gaussian vibrational analysis [whitepaper](https://gaussian.com/wp-content/uploads/dl/vib.pdf). You can take this matrix from the output file but **beware**, these are scaled by the square root of the reduced mass and so this scaling must be undone to get the true $\mathbf{L_\mathrm{CART}}$.

Then, for each mode, multiply each element of $\mathbf{L_\mathrm{CART}}$ by the per-atom dipole derivative vector from the `.fchk` file, and sum up all contributions in each direction to give a single three element vector describing the dipole derivative with respect to a given mode in $x$, $y$, and $z$. Finally, convert these values from $\left[\mathrm{e\,u^{-\frac{1}{2}}}\right]$ to $\left[\sqrt{\mathrm{km\, mol^{-1}}}\right]$ by multiplying by 31.2231, this then gives the same values as those printed by the IOp command.

$$
31.2231 \left[\mathrm{e^{-1}\,u^{1/2}\,km^{1/2}\,mol^{-1/2}}\right] = \frac{\sqrt{42.2561\left[\mathrm{km\,mol^{-1}\,u\,Å^2\,D^{-2}}\right]}\cdot 1.602\times10^{-19}\left[\mathrm{C\,e^{-1}}\right]}{3.3356\times 10^{-20} \left[\mathrm{C\,Å\,D^{-1}}\right]}
$$
