Pseudospin Hamiltonians and wavefunctions are often employed in the single-molecule-magnet and qubit literature as a means of describing a small subset of a much larger group of states. This is particularly useful for a few reasons, but before delving deeper let's set out some useful starting points.

## The Zeeman effect

The magnetic moment $\bold{\mu}$ of a particle is a vector quantity and is proportional to the particle's spin $\bold{S}$, with a dimensionless proportionality constant called the $g$ value. Here we are going to consider a single isolated electron, and so we use the free electron $g$ value $g_\mathrm{e}$.

$$
\bold{\mu} = g_\mathrm{e} \mu_\mathrm{B} \bold{S}
$$

where $\mu_\mathrm{B}$ is the Bohr magneton, which is a constant that essentially accounts for the units of the magnetic moment.

Magnetic moments can interact with magnetic fields $\bold{B}$ in a process known as the Zeeman effect, and this interaction is described by the Zeeman Hamiltonian

$$
\hat{H}_\mathrm{Zeeman} = \bold{\mu}\cdot\bold{B} = g_\mathrm
{e}\mu_\mathrm{B}\hat{\bold{S}}\cdot\bold{B}
$$

where $\hat{\bold{S}}$ denotes the operator nature of the spin. If we know $\bold{B}$ and $\hat{\bold{S}}$ we can calculate the energies of the electronic spin states. The vector operator $\hat{\bold{S}}$ is made up of spin operators for the three cartesian axes

$$
\hat{\bold{S}} = \left [ \hat{S}_x, \hat{S}_y, \hat{S}_z\right] \ \ ,
$$

and similarly the field vector $\bold{B}$ has scalar Scomponents along $x$, $y$, and $z$

$$
\bold{B} = \left [ B_x, B_y, B_z\right] \ \ ,
$$

so we can expand the dot-product in $\hat{H}_\mathrm{Zee}$ to give

$$
\hat{H}_\mathrm{Zeeman} = g_\mathrm{e} \mu_\mathrm{B} (\hat{S}_x B_x + \hat{S}_y B_y + \hat{S}_z B_z ) \ \ .
$$

To make life easier we can define $B_x=B_y=0\neq B_z$ so that $\hat{H}_\mathrm{Zee}$ becomes

$$
\hat{H}_\mathrm{Zeeman} = g_\mathrm{e} \mu_\mathrm{B} \hat{S}_z B_z \ \ .
$$

From this it is trivial to obtain the (hopefully) familiar equation for the energy of the electron when its spin is aligned either with or against the magnetic field, otherwise known as the Zeeman splitting

$$
E = \pm\frac{g_\mathrm{e}\mu_\mathrm{B}B}{2}\\
\Delta E = g_\mathrm{e}\mu_\mathrm{B}B \ \ .
$$

But what if we're not dealing with a free electron? In that case the value of $g$ changes and will not longer be a fixed quantity, so it must be calculated or measured experimentally. Additionally, $g$ might gain a dependence on direction, and so ut can more generally be represented as a tensor $\bold{g}$ which has components describing the effect of an arbitrarily oriented magnetic field on a set of states.

$$
\bold{g} = \begin{bmatrix}
g_{xx} & g_{xy} & g_{xz}\\
g_{yz} & g_{yy} & g_{yz}\\
g_{zx} & g_{zy} & g_{zz}\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This more general definition looks complicated, but in fact it allows us to define **a compact method for describing the effect of a magnetic field on a two level system involving a set of values $g_{\alpha, \beta}$.**

## Crystal Fields

The electronic structures of lanthanide qubits and SMMs are often discussed in terms of the Hund's rule ground term of the lanthanide in question. For example, Dy(III) is commonly employed in SMMs and has a $^6 \mathrm{H}$ Hund's rule ground term arising from its 4f<sup>9</sup> electron configuration. Within this term the $J=15/2$ multiplet is lowest in energy, and contains a set of 16 $m_J$ states which are degenerate in the absence of any crystal or magnetic field. When such fields are applied, this degeneracy is lifted, and in the case of the crystal field (CF), this effect can be described using a CF Hamiltonian

$$
\hat{H}_\mathrm{CF} = \sum_{k=2, 4, ..., 2J} \sum_{q=-k}^{k} \theta^k B_k^q \hat{O}_k^q
$$

where $\theta^k$ are a set of numerical factors which are constant for a given lanthanide ion, $B_k^q$ is a crystal field parameter which is unique to a given system, and $\hat{O}_k^q$ is a Stevens operator that can be calculated from the angular momentum operators $\hat{J}_\alpha, \hat{J}^2 \ \ (\alpha = x, y, z, +, -)$.

If we consider a (hypothetical) perfectly axial CF then $\hat{H}_\mathrm{CF}$ can be reduced to just the terms with $q=0$, and we can make a further simplification by using only terms with $k=2,4,6$.

Inputting the values $B_2^0 = 1000 \ \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $B_4^0 = 100 \ \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and $B_6^0 = 10 \ \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ into the above Hamiltonian and diagonalising the resulting matrix representation yields a set of crystal field wavefunctions $\psi_i$ with energies $E_i$ (Figure 1).

We see that there are now 8 pairs of degenerate states (doublets) with opposite values of $m_J$. The low energy (< 1000 cm<sup>-1</sup>) doublets are well separated from each other, and so each doublet could be treated as a *pseudo* $S=1/2$ system using a similar approach to that of a single electron. This would allow us to study how these states change as a function of field, and make use of some clever tricks to visualise the magnetic nature of these states in three dimensions!

## Finding the pseudospin g values

To recast the doublets as pseudo $S=1/2$ systems we shall use the g-tensor defined earlier as a *phenomenological* connection between the applied magnetic field and the magnetic moment (and/or energy) of our states. But, how do we find the values of the g-tensor? We could apply a magnetic field $\bold{B}$ to our CF states and record how they change as $\bold{B}$ is varied, but this is a long and laborious process which is at the mercy of numerical instabilities!

Instead, we can use a formula proposed by Gerloch and McMeeking which connects elements of the total magnetic moment operator $\hat{\mu}_J$ (written in the basis of CF wavefunctions) to the g-tensor. From now on the $J$ suscript has been dropped for brevity.

$$
(g \cdot g^\mathrm{T})_{\alpha,\beta} = G_{\alpha,\beta} = \sum_{u=\psi, \psi'}\sum_{v=\psi, \psi'}\mu_{\alpha_{u,v}}\mu_{\beta_{v,u}}
$$

The variables $\alpha$ and $\beta$ specify the cartesian directions $x$, $y$, and $z$, and $\psi$ and $\psi'$ are the CF wavefunctions of a given doublet.

The total magnetic moment operator $\hat{\mu}$ is analogous to the free electron magnetic moment operator

$$
\hat{\mu}_\alpha = g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} \hat{J}_\alpha
$$

save for the substitution of the $g_\mathrm{e}$ with the Land√© g-factor $g_J$ which is a scalar that can be calculated from $L$, $S$, and $J$. The matrix representation of this operator can be constructed in a basis of $m_J$ states and subsequently transformed into the basis of CF wavefunctions using the eigenvectors of the CF matrix.

Using this recipe the $\bold{G}$ tensor can be constructed, and its matrix square root taken to obtain the $\bold{g}$ tensor.

$$
\bold{G}_\mathrm{diag} = \bold{V}^{-1}\bold{G}\bold{V}\\
\bold{g} = \bold{V}\bold{G}_\mathrm{diag}^{1/2}\bold{V}^{-1}
$$

This can then be used in the Zeeman Hamiltonian to obtain the magnetic field dependence of a given doublet. But... that's not particularly useful, nor accurate since the doublets are treated separately. Instead, the true usefulness of this pseudospin g-tensor comes when it is diagonalised to give g-vectors and g-values. The g-vectors specify the main magnetic axes of the doublet in three-dimensions, and the g-values specify how strongly the magnetic field affects the doublets when placed aligned along these axes.

As an example, we can compute $\bold{g}$ for the ground doublet shown in Figure 1, where we find that the g-values are 0, 0, and 20, and the corresponding g vectors are x, y, and z. Since we have a strong axial crystal field and this doublet has large mJ values, this tells us that the z-axis is most easily magnetisable (easy axis), and that a magnetic field will not affect our system when placed along x and y. n.b. this is only true when the magnetic field is sufficiently weaker than the crystal field such that it can be considered a perturbation. On the other hand, the highest energy doublet has relatively small mJ values and so it is unsurprising while the g-values are still 0 0 !=0, the z-axis is less easily magnetisable!
