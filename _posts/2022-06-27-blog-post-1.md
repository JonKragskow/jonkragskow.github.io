![Ln(III) Ground Term 4f Charge Densities](/images/webversion.webp)

These are the free-ion charge density plots for the mJ states of the ground Hund's rule term of each Ln(III) ion as calculated and derived by Sievers. The plot is produced in the same style as Reinhart and Long but instead uses The University of Manchester's gold and purple colours. Eu(III) and Gd(III) are missing as they have $J=0$ and $L=0$ ground states respectively.

Interactive free-ion densities can be visualised [here](https://www.waveplot.com/apps/4f%20density_app).
